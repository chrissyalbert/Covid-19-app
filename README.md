# Covid-19 Cases

This website takes data from the New York Times CSV repository and compiles into a chart format with the help of chart.js. The goal of mapping the data in a chart format is to see if and when cases in a particular area flatten out rather than to continue to curve upward. The new cases charts help show the growth rate of cases in each area.
